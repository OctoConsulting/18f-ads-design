# Introduction #
Lasso is an openFDA solution developed by Octo Consulting Group (Octo) in response to the solicitation released by GSA 18F for Agile Delivery Services (ADS). Using adverse event and recall data from openFDA’s drug dataset, Lasso provides a holistic view of a drug’s adverse events and recalls. Currently, Lasso is in prototype form only. The key highlights of our approach include:
*   Focus on user experience through the creation of user personas, user testing and market surveys
*   Use of Kanban for managing the backlog for User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX)

# Description of Our Approach #
## Planning Phase ##
Octo assembled a project team consisting of experienced agile experts, UI/UX designers, and analysts. A group of Octo employees served as "users" during the development of the prototype, and reviewed FDA APIs to craft an initial problem statement that served as the scope for the project team ([Problem Statement](https://github.com/OctoConsulting/18f-ads-pool-1/blob/master/docs/Agile/Octo%2018F%20Problem%20Statement.docx)).

## Agile Development Phase ##
### Sprint # 0 (Planning) ###
The project team reviewed the problem statement and analyzed the dataset to understand the API and data, which drove the architecture definition and development of initial user experience artifacts ([User Personas](https://github.com/OctoConsulting/18f-ads-pool-1/tree/master/docs/UX/User%20Personas)).

During this Sprint, the team also:
*   Identified high level features required to meet the needs of the users
*   Decomposed the features into user and technical stories that could be completed in a single sprint
*   Created a product vision and roadmap for delivery of features in multiple releases

### Sprint # 1..N (Sprinting) ###
The UI/UX team tracked their work using Kanban to ensure they stay ahead of the development team ([Kanban System](https://github.com/OctoConsulting/18f-ads-pool-1/tree/master/docs/Agile)). The team initially planned for 3 production releases of the prototype. Features were planned for each Release, and individual stories for each feature were slotted in sprints within each Release. The team made adjustments to the product based on user feedback after each demo to the users and by collaborating with the users while working within the constraints imposed by the APIs. For example, we proposed an alternate set of features to the users when the FDA API could not provide some of the data needed for a specific features requested.

User stories were documented in a product backlog, with multiple versions reflecting the changing features identified by users. The team planned stories to be completed in each sprint, estimated story points, and reviewed completed stories with the Product Manager.  At the end of each sprint, a product demo was conducted, feedback collected, product deployed to production, and a sprint review and retrospective completed.  All user and design documentation necessary for the execution of the sprint was constantly updated.

### User Experience Approach ###

The information gathered from users was used to continuously refine the prototype.  After every iteration with the user, UX/UI specialists performed heuristic evaluations, and conducted usability tests to refine the wireframes and final product.  Throughout the process, the UX/UI team worked closely with the development team to ensure all user interface changes were implemented in the prototype.

The project team captured user feedback in several ways and produced multiple UX/UI artifacts to ensure the prototype was developed in alignment with user needs:
*   Met with the user to ensure that the problem statement was fully understood, to discuss desired features, and prioritization for all features
*   Created user personas to capture demographics and needs of different users of the prototype
*   Distributed an electronic survey for desired features and expected usage of the prototype ([User Surveys](https://github.com/OctoConsulting/18f-ads-pool-1/tree/master/docs/UX/User%20Survey))
*   Generated Workflows to document how a user progresses through the prototype ([Workflows](https://github.com/OctoConsulting/18f-ads-pool-1/tree/master/docs/UX/User%20Workflows))
*   Created a basic wireframe and prototype of the homepage to lay a foundation for the prototype ([Wireframes](https://github.com/OctoConsulting/18f-ads-pool-1/tree/master/docs/UI))
*   Created an information architecture to organize site content and enriched content using visualizations and metadata

## Closeout ##

During this phase, the team performed final field testing to ensure the application met the needs of the users and conducted usability testing with a broader set of Octo employees.  The team closed out the execution of the prototype by completing the documentation necessary for submitting the solicitation response to the government.
